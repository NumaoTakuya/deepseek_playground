## Tech Stack

- **Next.js** (TypeScript)
- **Firebase** (Auth, Firestore)
- **MUI** for UI components
- **React Markdown** for message rendering
- **Deepseek** for AI text generation

## Setup & Installation

1. **Clone** this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/deepseek-playground.git
```

2. **Install dependencies**:

```bash
cd deepseek-playground
yarn install   # or: npm install
```

3. **Run local dev**:

```bash
yarn dev
```

- The app is served at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

1. **Log in** with Google on the home page (`/`).
2. **Enter your Deepseek API key** in the sidebar.
3. Go to `/chat` to create a new chat → Type your first message & system prompt → click “Send.”
4. A new thread is stored in Firestore, a short conversation title is generated, and the assistant responds.
5. Continue the conversation at `/chat/[threadId]`. The system prompt can be adjusted from the top bar.

## Security Note

- The Firebase config in `src/services/firebase.ts` is typically “public” for a web app.
- The user’s **Deepseek API key** is stored in the browser (localStorage) and not saved in Firestore.
- No service accounts or secret keys are included.
